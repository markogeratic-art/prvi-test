Dicky bird. Dicky! Where are you?

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.232
Here, Dicky.

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:58.081

Rudolf, have you seen Dicky bird?

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.320
I've looked everywhere.

[hiccups]

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.926
Oh, dear, he's not here. He's gone.

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:47.058
He must be here.
He couldn't have gotten out of the house.

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:48.905
Here, Dicky.

Dicky.

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:12.908
Oh dear, he's flown away.

00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:15.878
I can't understand it.

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:19.564
That's the fifth canary
we've lost this month.

You miss your little friend, don't you?

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.936
Hello, pet shop?
Have you any more canaries?

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:42.714
Oh, that's fine.

00:02:42.782 --> 00:02:47.412
Will you send one right over
to 1605, Maple Drive?

00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:51.489
Yes, that's right, 1605 Maple Drive.

Nice little Petey.

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:16.869
Eat up all your seeds and get nice and big.

00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:22.537
And you, too, Rudolf.
Eat up all your dinner.

Rudolf.

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:03.270
Rudolf, where are you? Where are you?

00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:07.554
Petey, have you seen Rudolf?
