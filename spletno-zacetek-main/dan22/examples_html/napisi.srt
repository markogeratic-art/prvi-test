Here, Dicky.

00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:58,081
Dicky, come here.

00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:06,509
Rudolf, have you seen Dicky bird?

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,320
I've looked everywhere.

[hiccups]

10
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,926
Oh, dear, he's not here. He's gone.

11
00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:47,058
He must be here.
He couldn't have gotten out of the house.

12
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:48,905
Here, Dicky.

00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:09,808
Dicky.

18
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,908
Oh dear, he's flown away.

19
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,878
I can't understand it.

20
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:19,564
That's the fifth canary
we've lost this month.

22
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:28,125
Oh, poor Rudolf.

You miss your little friend, don't you?

24
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:39,936
Hello, pet shop?
Have you any more canaries?

25
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:42,714
Oh, that's fine.

26
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:47,412
Will you send one right over
to 1605, Maple Drive?

27
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:51,489
Yes, that's right, 1605 Maple Drive.

Nice little Petey.

34
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,869
Eat up all your seeds and get nice and big.

35
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:22,537
And you, too, Rudolf.
Eat up all your dinner.

Rudolf, where are you? Where are you?

44
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:07,554
